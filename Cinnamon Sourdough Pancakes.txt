OVERNIGHT CINNAMON SOURDOUGH PANCAKES :)

(Serves 2-4 people)
 
INGREDIENTS:

1C Flour
2/3C Almond Milk, unsweetened (milk and/or water will work)
1C Sourdough Starter
2 Eggs
2½ Tbsp Sugar**
¼ tsp Salt**
½ tsp Baking Soda**
1 tsp Cinnamon**
2 Tbsp Oil**

METHOD:

Night before:
-In a medium size bowl, mix the flour and almond milk together, then mix in the sourdough starter.
-Blend well. If it's hard to mix and too thick, add more liquid.
-Cover and let rest overnight on counter.
-Take out 2 eggs and leave on counter overnight to reach room temp.
-Feed your starter.


Morning:
-In a small bowl, beat eggs thoroughly and set aside. 
-In a small cup* mix the sugar, salt, baking soda, and cinnamon.
-Gradually add the sugar mixture to the eggs and add 2 Tbsp of oil (we use sunflower oil)
-Pour the egg mixture into the batter and mix evenly. 
-Cook pancakes, serve with desired toppings and enjoy :)

We use a cast iron pan on medium low heat (setting 3 on a standard stove), with sunflower oil to cook them. 
Butter and less oil can be added to the oil in the pan for less crispy edges but nice flavour.

*I do this in a small cup to mush any nasty lumps of baking soda or salt and to mix in the cinnamon evenly. 
**These are approximate amounts as I actually just eyeball it with regular spoons so tweak as needed. They won't be as fluffy if less baking soda is used.
